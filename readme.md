# mdx-metadata-extraction-experiments

> Modern experiments to extract metadata from MDX files.

In search of modern replacement to [extract-mdx-metadata](https://github.com/manovotny/extract-mdx-metadata) now that tooling has evolved / advanced.

## Getting Started

We're trying a few different approaches.

-   Using [@mdx-js/node-loader](https://mdxjs.com/packages/node-loader/), which can be tried using `npm run loader`.
-   Using [xdm's `evaluate`](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm#evaluatefile-options), which can be tried using `npm run evaluate`.
